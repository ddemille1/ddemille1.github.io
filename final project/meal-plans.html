                        <li>sour cream (garnish)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>In a large skillet saute onion and green pepper in oil. Brown hamburger or ground turkey. Add it to the slow cooker when it's done. Rinse the beans. Add beans and all other ingredients to the slow cooker. Cook for 8 hours on low or 4 hours on high. Top with garnishes of your choice. </p>

                    <h3>Cornbread</h3>
                    <p>Ingredients:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>1 box cornbread mix</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Prepare cornbread according to package directions. Keep in mind that you often need milk, eggs, and oil the make the mix. Usually bakes in under 30 minutes. Can use a 8" x 8" casserole or muffin tins lined with cupcake papers.</p>
                    <p>If you're short on time just use bread or a bag of rolls as your side. 
                    <p>Another option could be to serve the chili over potatoes. Poke holes in them with a fork and microwave for about 7 minutes. You could also cook them in the Instant Pot pretty quickly.</p>

                <h3>Southwest Scrambled Eggs</h3>
                <p>Ingredients:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>1 medium onion</li>
                    <li>1/2 green pepper</li>
                    <li>2-3 slices Deli meat</li>
                    <li>2-3 eggs</li>
                    <li>titch of Salsa</li>
                    <li>titch of shredded cheese</li>
                    <li>pinch pepper</li>
                    <li>pinch salt</li>
                    <li>tortillas (optional)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Saute diced onion and green pepper. Add diced deli meat. Add eggs - just scramble them in the
                    skillet as you cook them. Add cheese when almost done cooking. It will help them to not stick to the
                    pan. Served topped with salsa. Wrap it in a tortilla for a breakfast burrito if you want. </p>

                        <li>1 T vegetable or canola oil</li>

                        <li>1 can cream of mushroom soup</li>
                        <li>1/3 c cater </li>
                        <li>1/2 package egg noodles</li>
                        <li>2 T sour cream (optional)</li>
                        <li>1 can or 1/2 pkg Fresh mushrooms (optional)</li>
                        <li>dash black pepper</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Heat oil in a large skillet. Dice onions and saute in oil until they turn translucent. Add
                        hamburger or ground turkey and continue cooking until brown. You might want to add a bit of
                        extra water to keep it from burning. When meat is done add cream of mushroom soup and water
                        until desired viscosity is attained. While meat is cooking get water boiling in a large sauce
                        pan. Cook noodles according to package directions. Drain. Put meat sauce over noodles, sprinkle
                        with pepper and dig in! </p>
                    <p>If you don't have any noodles handy the sauce is also really good over bread or rice. Use a ratio
                        of 1:1.5 white rice to water and cook it in the instat pot using the rice setting</p>
                    <p><strong>Beast Mode:</strong> Step it up a notch by sauteing mushrooms with the onions. Also add
                        some sour cream along with the cream of mushroom soup. You could also substitue cubed stew meat
                        in place of ground meat. Saute it or use the Instant Pot to cook it.</p>
