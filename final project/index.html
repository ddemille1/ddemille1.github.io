                <p> Are you wondering what meals to plan for the week? Do you want to spend the least amount of time
                    cooking as possible? Do you want reasonably healthy, affordable meals with common ingredients? Are
                    you new to cooking?
                    <p> Here at Manly Meal Plans I seek to address all of these issues. I share some of my favorite,
                        easy meal plans. I use common ingredients that can be found in pretty much any grocery store. I
                        seek to have a good balance between making things from scratch and utilizing premade
                        ingredients. The recipes are basic and flexible. Add, subtract, scale them as you'd like. Most
                        recipes can be made in less than a half hour. Some recipes will take longer, but will utilize a
                        programmable slow cooker or pressure cooker so you can set it and forget it. </p>
                    <p> My recipes are not intended for the experienced, gourmet cook. They are intended for beginners
                        who just want to eat something and don't have all day to cook - bachelors, college students,
                        widdowers, single parents. As such, I've included a section dedicated to the equipment you'll
                        need. A section on basic techniques will be coming soon!</p>
                    <p>Enjoy the site!</p>
