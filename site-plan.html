      <h4>Heading Font: IM Fell Great Primer</h4>
      <p>Slightly slanted to yeild a sophisticated look, but not so much that it's difficult to read when used as the headings</p>

      <p>The slanted, curvy lines looks sophisticated and formal which will help emphasize the well-kempt, classy atmospere of the Inn</p>

        Plan on using our free changing room for you and your fellow patrons as
        you transition from traveling to the temple to actually entering the
        temple. We want you to feel comfortable changing and freshing up in
        order to focus on meaningful service. Let us take care of you.
